/*
    The reverseLinkedList function takes the head of the linked list as input and returns the head of the reversed list.
    It initializes three pointers: prev, current, and next. prev is initially set to nullptr, current is set to the head of the list, and next is set to nullptr.
    The function iterates through the list, reversing the links between nodes. At each iteration, it updates the next pointer to store the next node, sets the next pointer of the current node to the previous node (prev), and moves the prev and current pointers one step forward.
    After traversing the entire list, prev will point to the new head of the reversed list, so the function returns prev.
